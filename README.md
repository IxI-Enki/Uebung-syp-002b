#### [*SYP-PRE*] 
## *Uebung 002* -- ***Project Proposal***  
  > Jan Ritt  -  3ACIFT

# *P.P.P.*  
  
   >### Webspace to document personal programing progress  
  
---  

### Overview:  

<details>
<summary> A) quick Purpose: </summary>

## **A**) *PURPOSE*  
      
   -  Necessity [ Notwendigkeit ]  
      > I see a necessity in creating a well sorted, and "playable" webspace for all my programming adventures, 
        to be easy playable and for the code of said games to be easy read/investigated, to help myself as well as others in our future programming.

   -  Feasibility [ DurchfÃ¼hrbarkeit ]
      > The project is doable, with further experience, the webspace will grow for sure.      

   -  Affordability [ Leistbarkeit ]
      > I have a lot of time and some random hardware to evem host low-traffic websites myself.

   -  Market/Economic Effect [ Marktsituation ]
      > There are webspaces for such aplication out there, but non of my own,
      > so i rely on others to provide the service.

## **B**) *OUTLINE*  

### **1.) Initial Situation**:  
> ( NOTES go here )  
> ..  

#### a) *Situation*:  
  - > I see a necessity in creating a well sorted, and "playable" webspace for all my programming adventures  

  - > to be easy playable and for the code of said games to be easy read/investigated  

  - > to help myself as well as others in our future programming  
        
#### b) *Our abilities*:  
  - > I am learning different programming languages and want to keep track of my learning expirience  

  - > With growing knoledge, the progress shall be visible on the webspace and users should be able to trace it back

### **2.) General conditions & Constraints**:  
> ( NOTES go here )
> ..  

#### a) *Framework*:  
> outline the scope of the project  
> ( NOTES go here )  
> ..  

- *Budget*:  
    > initial costs are low, exept dor the inversted time  
  - *Knowhow*:  
    > my knowhow is growing and expanding, as explained, the process of "growing" might be interesting to see  
  - *Colaborators*:  
    > it is hard to find somone who commits in a regular manner, therfor i decided to do it own my own
    - commitments to colaborators  
  - *Deadlines*:  
    > Dates for handing in project progress:  
    -  15.10.2023 --  hand in PROJECT PROPOSAL  
    -  22.10.2023 --   
    -  29.10.2023 --  
#### b) *Technical*:  
> ( NOTES go here )  
> ..  

  - *development environment*:  
    - Microsoft Visual Studio   
    
    > C++, C#, ... extending ...  
    - vim for   
  
    > zsh, other shell scripts ... extending ...
    - Unity  
    - Godot  
  
   > ..  
   > ... extending ...  
   > ...  

  - *platforms*:  
    > PC, Linux, Android, maybe more .. 
  
  - *IT Infrastructure*:  
    > for the time being (low traffic in the beginning) a self-hosted server should be sufficient.
  
  - *Standards & Regulations*:  
    > no known one (for now)

### **3.) Objectives & Concepts**:  
  > The Vision of the Project:  
  > without the technical Details  
  > ( NOTES go here )  

#### a)  *own private "Micro-program-platform"*:  
   - host my own micro-Programs and micro-Games  
   - for learning, commenting and keep track of my progress  
  ...

#### b)  *easy view and play with (execute) code*:  
   - each program shall have their fixed pages for "execute code"  
     > for example to run a game of Tik-Tak-Toe  
   - fixed pages for code viewing  
     > to read a very well documented code line by line, while executing them in the other tab/window  

#### c)  *Comment on code and progress*:  
   - Users shall be able to comment under Programs and rate them, possibly even embed applications in their own webspace
     >

### **4.) Opportunities & Risks**:  
 > ( NOTES go here )  
 > ..  

#### a) *Market analysis*:  
  - There are other sites than github etc.  
    > that let's you host your own programs, and even make them playable anline 
    but they are all packed with adverts and you have to comply to their code of conduct etc...

#### b) *Customers*:  
   - At the Start I am my own customer, 
   this can and will be expanded, further down the road.
     > Possibly make the webspace so that people can comment and give feedback on codes and executeables  

#### c) *Profit*:  
   - If the system is running and there is traffic ..  
     > decent adverts, 
     > for programming related products etc.. could be implemented

#### d) *Loss*:  
   - Highest risk is a big loss of time  
      > If there is no final deadline, this project could run and document for a long time  
  
----   
### **5.) Planing**:  
 > ( NOTES go here )  
 > ..  

#### a) *Milestones*:  
- setting up the proposal  
- setting up the barebones of the webspace  
- gathering the first Programs  
- impliment them  
- ...


#### b) *Team*:  

- Ersteller:
